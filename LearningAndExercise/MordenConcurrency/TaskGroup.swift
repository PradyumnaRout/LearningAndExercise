 ✅ Why Use TaskGroup?

 Here are the main reasons:

 1. Run many tasks at the same time (in parallel):
 If you want to perform async work on multiple items (like downloading files or processing data), TaskGroup lets all those tasks run concurrently.

 2. Automatically wait for all tasks to finish:
 With TaskGroup, you don’t manually track when each task is done. The group handles it for you — you just collect the results.

 3. Better structured code:
 All tasks in the group are contained within one scope (withTaskGroup), making your code clean and easy to manage.

 4. Safe and cancellable:
 If the parent task is cancelled, all child tasks in the group are automatically cancelled too.
 
 🔍 When Should You Use TaskGroup?
 
 | Use Case                                     | Use `TaskGroup`?                   |
 | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
 | Run independent tasks in parallel            | ✅ Yes                              |
 | Wait for all async tasks to finish           | ✅ Yes                              |
 | Manage child task cancellation automatically | ✅ Yes                              |
 | Run one async task only                      | ❌ No (just use `await`)            |
 | Want ordered results like `.map`             | ⚠ Build your own or use `asyncMap` |

 
 ✅ In Short

 TaskGroup is used to:

 ✔ Run many async tasks in parallel
 ✔ Collect their results
 ✔ Keep concurrency safe and structured
 ✔ Simplify cancellation and error handling

// MARK: - Question:
// with swift taskgroup I can execute multiple task concurrently, and I think I can only get the result after the completion of all task inside the task group. But if I want some result independent of another and they will execute concurrently, then what should I use

/*
 ✅ withTaskGroup (and withThrowingTaskGroup) executes multiple tasks concurrently, but you can only start getting results as they complete, and the function itself doesn’t return until all tasks in the group finish.
 
 However, you can consume results incrementally as tasks finish — and if you want even looser coupling (tasks that don’t depend on each other and don’t have to wait for the group to finish), you have a few different patterns. Let’s go through them clearly 👇

     It’s often used for background or fire-and-forget work like:

         Important behavior to understand:
         
         🔹 async let children are structured child tasks. If one child throws and that error is propagated out (i.e., you try await and don't swallow the error), Swift will cancel the sibling child tasks when the parent scope exits due to that error.

         🔹 You must await all child tasks (either explicitly, or implicitly by awaiting a tuple). The compiler enforces that child tasks are awaited or otherwise handled before leaving the scope.
