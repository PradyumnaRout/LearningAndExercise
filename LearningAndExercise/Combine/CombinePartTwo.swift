// PUBLISHER IN DEPTH

/// 🔹 What is a Publisher?
/**
  A publisher is an object that emits a sequency of values over time.
 
 It can emit:
 1. Values (one or many)
 2. A completion event (Finished or Failure)
 
 Formally Every publisher in combine must confirm to the Publisher Protocol:
 
 protocol Publisher {
    associatedType Output
    associatedType Failure: Error
 
     func receive<S>(subscriber: S)
        Where S: Subscriber,
              self.Failure == S.Failure
              self.Output == S.Input
 }
 
 
 Output - The type of value it publishes.
 Failure - The type of error it might publish (or Neve if it can not fail).
 
 🔹 LifeCycle of Publisher -  After either a regular finished event or a failure, the subject will pass no more values. This is due    to the lifecycle of a subject.
 
 🔹 Key Takeaways
         Publishers emit values and completion events.
         Just is for one-off values.
         Future is for async, single-value work.
         PassthroughSubject is for manual event broadcasting.
         CurrentValueSubject holds onto the latest value.
         Deferred creates publishers only when subscribed.
         Collections can easily become publishers with .publisher.

// 🔹 Common Publishers in Combine
/// 1. Just - A publisher that emits an output to each subscriber just once, and then finishes.
/// Emits single value and then finishes. for example if you want to use it in a UISwitch everytime it chnages sate. You can not do that because it Fires once, then it's done. Your switch keeps flipping, but the publisher is silent.

class JustPub {
    var cancellable = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    let justPublisher = Just("Hello, World")
    let apiURL = URL(string: "http://api.example.com/current-temperature")
    
    struct TemperatureInfo: Codable {
        var city: String
        var temperature: Double
    }
    
    func subscribeJust() {
        justPublisher
            .sink(
                receiveCompletion: { print("Completion: \($0)") },
                receiveValue: { print("Value: \($0)") }
            )
            .store(in: &cancellable)
    }
    
    ///Another use case of Just publisher is often employed to initiate another single-run pipeline or to provide a placeholder response as a fallback response when a failure occurs.
    func asFailureError() {
        let temperaturePublisher = URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: apiURL!)
        // The dataTaskPublisher output combination of
        // (data: Data, response: URLResponse)
            .map { inputTuple -> Data in
                return inputTuple.data
            }
            .decode(type: TemperatureInfo.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
            .catch { error in
                // Default value in case of an error
                Just(TemperatureInfo(city: "Unknown", temperature: 72.0))
            }
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
        
        
        temperaturePublisher.sink { temperatureInfo in
            print("City: \(temperatureInfo.city), Temperature: \(temperatureInfo.temperature)")
        }.store(in: &cancellable)
    }
}
/**
 O/P -
 Value: Hello, World!
 Completion: finished
 */


/// 2. Future (Future<Output, Failure>)
/**
 A Future in combine is a publisher that eventually produces a single value or an error, facilitated by a Promise.
 The Promise wraps asynchronous operation within an escaping closure, which is called when the Future publisher is ready to emit an event
 
 Important:- When dealing with an asynchronous API that can potentially produce multiple values over time, using the Future publisher directly may not be the best choice, as it’s designed for a single value. Also you can’t use retry operator with it.
 */
/// A Future publisher has the same retirement plan as Just. It performs its work one time and then completes forever. No callbacks after that. No encore performance. In the land of switches that keep flipping, a Future behaves like:
/// “I heard the first toggle! Cool, my job is done. Goodbye.” (switch: keeps flipping wildly but Future is already in Hawaii)
/// Emits a single value in future (Usually async
/// Greate for wrapping asynchronous code (like network request)

class FuturePub {

 This publisher is initialised with no initial value and can emit multiple values over time but won’t store any of them for future references. The subscriber is attached to the publisher and it will receive all values sent to the publisher using the send(_:) method. However, if a subscriber attaches after a value has been emitted, they won’t be notified. Let’s see this in code
 
 It’s important to note that PassthroughSubject does not buffer values that are sent when no subscribers are listening. If a value is sent and there are no subscribers, the value is simply discarded. If you need to ensure that subscribers receive all values, even those sent before they subscribe, you should use a type of subject that does buffer values, such as ReplaySubject or BehaviorSubject.

 Useful when you don’t want the publisher to do work until needed.
