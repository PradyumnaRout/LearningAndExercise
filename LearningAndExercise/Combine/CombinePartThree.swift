// 🔷 Subscriber:
/*
➡ If a publisher is the "Speaker", then a subscriber is the "Listner". Without subscribers, no values flow in combine - the pipeline stays idle.
 
 🔵 A Subsciber is responsible for -
 ➡ Receiving values from a publisher.
 ➡ Handling Completion events(Success or Failure).
 ➡ Controlling how much demand it has for values.
 
 In other words subscribers decide what to do with data once it is published.
 
 Formally a Subscriber Conforms to the Sibscriber Protocol.
 
     protocol Subscriber {
         associatedtype Input
         associatedtype Failure: Error
         
         func receive(subscription: Subscription)
         func receive(_ input: Input) -> Subscribers.Demand
         func receive(completion: Subscribers.Completion<Failure>)
     }
 
 
 🔹 Key Takeaways
         Subscribers consume values emitted by publishers.
         sink is the go-to subscriber for quick value handling.
         assign is perfect for directly binding values to object properties.
         Subscribers can control demand to manage how many values they want at once.

// 🔹 Built-in Subscribers
// sink ::
/**
 The most commonly used subscriber.
 it lets you provide tow closure:
 
 ● One for handling values.
 ● One for handling completion (Success or Failure).
 */

class SinkSubscriber {
    var cancellable = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
    
    func subscribe() {
        numbers.publisher
            .sink { completion in
                switch completion {
                case .finished:
                    print("Values fetched successfully")
                case .failure(let error):
                    print("Error occured: \(error)")
                }
            } receiveValue: { value in
                print("Value: \(value)")
            }
            .store(in: &cancellable)

    }
}

// assign ::
// A subscriber that automatically assigns received values to a property.
// 👉 assign is super useful for updating UI properties or model values directly.

    var cancellable = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    var name: String = "" {
        didSet {

            let namePublisher = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"].publisher
            
            namePublisher
                .assign(to: \.name, on: user)
                .store(in: &user.cancellable)
        }

            .assign(to: \.self.name, on: self)
            .store(in: &cancellable)
    }
}

// 🔹 Demand and Backpressure ::
/**
 
 One unique aspect of combine is backpressure handling.
 Subscribers can control how many vlaues they want to receive at a time using demand.
 

 👉 Even though the publisher had 5 values, the subscriber only requested 2.
 This mechanism helps prevent overwhelming subscribers with too much data.
